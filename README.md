# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Analysis Overview

In this analysis, we used Scikit-learn and Imbalanced-learn libraries to build different machine learning models in order to predict credit risk for a lending institution. We also assessed how well each model works based on their accuracy scores, precision and recall scores.

## Result

The balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores for each model are as below:

Native Random Oversampling: the balanced accuracy score is 0.66, precision score is 0.01 for high risk loan and 1 for low risk loan. The recall score is 0.66 for high risk loan and 0.67 for low risk loan.
